You would attempt to guess the right answer currently there a few bugs that I was unfortunately not able to fix.
Timer is currently bugged as it wont restart with the game.
Doesn't seem that the score counter will work it will work no matter what guess you hit.
Haven't attempted to be get the score to stay in local storage.
